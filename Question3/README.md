The SQL I used is in db.sql
I executed multiple instances of generate.php to generate the data I needed
I created prefixes.php from wikipedia which is used to generate fake numbers
You will need to composer install in order to generate data using faker
You can change the database connection settings in config.php
To run the solution, execute answer.php after setup
